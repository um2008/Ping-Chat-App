PING is a chat web application designed with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) tech stack. Here's a simplified outline of the steps involved in creating the PING messaging service prototype:

1. **Setting Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB.
   - Create a new React.js project for the frontend.
   - Set up a Node.js server for the backend.

2. **Frontend Development (React.js):**
   - Develop components for user registration and authentication.
   - Create a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving text messages.
   - Implement group chat functionality.
   - Utilize Chakra UI, a popular open-source UI library for React applications.
   - Integrate real-time message updates using WebSocket technology like Socket.io.

3. **Backend Development (Node.js):**
   - Establish API routes for user registration and authentication.
   - Implement APIs for sending and receiving text messages.
   - Add endpoints for creating and managing group chats.
   - Integrate real-time updates using WebSocket technology like Socket.io.

4. **Database (MongoDB - NoSQL):**
   - Design the database schema for storing user data, messages, and group chats.
   - Implement database operations for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for user data, messages, and group chats.
   - Connect the MongoDB database to the server using Mongoose.

5. **User Authentication:**
   - Employ JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
   - Safely store user passwords by hashing them using BCrypt.

This setup allows PING to offer key functionalities, including user registration and authentication, text messaging, group chat capabilities, and real-time message updates. The MERN stack ensures both frontend and backend components work seamlessly together to provide a comprehensive chat web app experience.

**Features offered:**
1. User Authentication.
2. Real-Time Chatting with indicators.
3. One-to-one chat.
4. Search Users.
5. Create Group Chats.
6. Add/Remove People.
7. View User Profile.
8. Real-Time Notifications.
